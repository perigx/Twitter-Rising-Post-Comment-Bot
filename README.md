<h1 align="center">Twitter Rising Post Comment Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This automation bot is built to **detect and comment on rising or trending tweets** from high-engagement accounts—perfect for boosting brand visibility, promoting posts, or driving attention to linked content. It works by monitoring the timeline or specific profiles and commenting early with text or media to get noticed before the crowd.

It’s optimized for stealth, multi-account scale, and **natural behavior emulation**, making it ideal for creators, growth hackers, and marketers looking to automate Twitter engagement without getting flagged.


## Core Features:
- **Undetectable Operation with Proxy Rotation:** Avoids bans and rate limits using session isolation, headless browsers, and proxy cycling.
- **Real-Time Trending Tweet Detection:** Identifies rising tweets based on engagement velocity, keywords, or account size.
- **Mass Commenting Support:** Easily handles dozens or hundreds of accounts, with configurable delays and message variations.
